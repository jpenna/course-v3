# Glossary

## Tensor

In AI, tensor is a structured array. If it is 4x3, all the rows and columns have expected data.

## Learning Rate

The value we multiply the gradient ("slope") to decide how much to update the weight.

## Epoch

One complete run through all of our data points. 

Every epoch is a pass through the images. The more epochs, the bigger the chance of overfitting. So generally we don't want to do too many epochs.

## Minibatch

A set of random data points used to update the weight.

## SGD (Stochastic gradient descent)

Gradient descent (approximate the local minimum of a differentiable function) using minibatches.

## Model / Architecture

The mathematical function we are fitting the parameters.

## Parameters (coefficients, weights)

The values we are updating.

## Loss function

Tells how far or close we are to the correct answer.
